# Diagrams as Code

## Render a Mermaid diagram in GitHub

Here are a few examples of Mermaid diagrams:

```mermaid
graph 
a --> b;
```

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
a --> b: am i alone?
b --> a: i see you
```

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice-->John: Hello John, how are you?
    John-->>Alice: Great!
```

> "Separate the content from the presentation"

> â€” Simon Brown, from his C4 model documentation: [https://c4model.com/](https://c4model.com/)

The examples above demonstrate a direct, text-to-visual representation of a diagram.

**Question:** Is it possible to achieve a separation of the diagram's core information from its visual presentation using only Markdown and GitHub? If not, what additional tools or approaches would be required?
